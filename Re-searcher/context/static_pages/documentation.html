<span class="title"> 1. About Re-searcher <a name="1" id="1"></a></span>
<p class="text">Re-searcher is a highly configurable
system for recurrent PSI-BLAST searches. It enables timely detection of
new homologs in the protein sequence databases. Searches can be done on
a local server or at NCBI. It has a user-friendly web interface. </p>

<p class="text">Re-searcher has been developed by
Valdemaras Rep&scaron;ys, Mindaugas Margelevičius and Česlovas
Venclovas at the Institute of Biotechnology, Laboratory of
Bioinformatics, Vilnius, Lithuania.</p>

<p class="text">To use Re-searcher, enter a new protein
sequence (query) and choose PSI-BLAST parameters for the search. Each
user has his own sequence (query) list for which PSI-BLAST searches are
executed periodically.</p>

<p class="text">Sequences which have new hits are marked
with red color. User can always see all the hits found. New hits are
also marked with red color. The user gets an email notification
whenever new hits are found if he selects this option when entering a
new sequence. Note that the SMTP address must be configured for this
feature to work. </p>

<p class="text">There is a possibility to perform double
searches. In such case, the search is being performed within two
distinct databases. For instance, if you choose to perform the primary
search on the NR database and the secondary search on the PDB database
then the last PSI-BLAST iteration will be performed against the PDB
database using PSSM resulting from the search against the NR database. </p>

<span class="title">2. Getting Re-searcher </span><a name="2" id="2"></a>
<p class="text">Re-searcher is an open source project
licensed under GPL license. You can download it for free from&nbsp;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=173135">sourceforge.net</a>.
</p>

<span class="title">3. Installing Re-searcher </span><a name="3" id="3"></a>
<p class="text">Make sure that you have java runtime
environment version 6 or higher and java binary is in your path. You
can check java version and whether it is in path by writing 'java
-version' in your command line. If you don't have java, you can
download it from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp">www.java.com</a>.
</p>

<p class="text">Download researcher-windows.tar.gz or
researcher-linux.tar.gz for windows or linux operating systems
respectively. Uncompress the archive to the desired location. That's
it! </p>

<p class="text"><strong>Additional Notes</strong><br />

Sometimes you might want to change the hostname or the port of the
Re-searcher's web server, this can be done by editing
config/config.properties file. </p>

<p class="subtitle"><strong>Running Re-searcher on
your own web server </strong></p>

<p class="text">Re-searcher comes bundled with the Jetty
web server. If you want to run Re-searcher on your own web server (like
Tomcat), you have to download&nbsp;researcher.jar. It contains the
standard directory hierarchy for a java web application. IMPORTANT:
When running Re-searcher using your own java web server (servlet
container) you must set a few java options: derby.system.home -
directory for the Re-searcher's database (usually just a location of an
empty direcory, the database gets created there automatically on the
first run), log4j.conf - path to the log4j.properties file. You can get
an example of log4j.properties from one of the Re-searcher's archives
conf/log4j.properties </p>

<span class="title">4. Starting and stopping Re-searcher </span><a name="4" id="4"></a>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>Windows</strong></p>

<p class="text">To start the Re-searcher you can execute
bin/researcher.bat. </p>

<p class="text">If you want Re-searcher to start every
time you boot your computer you can install it as a windows service by
clicking on bin/install-service.bat. After installing the service you
start it with bin/start-service.bat. To stop the service, execute the
bin/stop-service.bat file. To uninstall the service execute
bin/uninstall-service.bat file. </p>

<p class="text">The application can take a few minutes to
start. To begin using Re-searcher go to the following link in your web
browser: http://localhost:8080/Researcher/app (localhost must be
replaced by a different hostname, if it is configured like this in
config/config.properties file) </p>

<p class="subtitle"><strong>Linux</strong></p>

<p class="text">In linux Re-searcher is controlled with
bin/researcher file. 'bin/researcher start' command starts the program
in a background process, 'bin/researcher stop' stops it.
'bin/researcher status' shows whether the program is currently running
or not. </p>

<p class="text">Also it is possible to start Re-searcher
in the current console to see all the output. For this you need to
execute 'bin/researcher console' command. You can then stop it by
pressing ctrl+c. </p>

<p class="text">The application can take a few minutes to
start. To begin using Re-searcher go to the following link in your web
browser: http://localhost:8080/Researcher/app (localhost must be
replaced by a different hostname, if it is configured like this in
config/config.properties file) </p>

<span class="title">5. Configuring Re-searcher </span><a name="5" id="5"></a>
<p class="text">When you run the application for the first
time, you might want to configure some options like the local PSI-BLAST
server address, the SMTP address and so on.</p>

<p class="text">To access the application enter the
address http://localhost:8080/Researcher/app in your web browser. The
login window should appear. When application runs for the first time,
user admin is created with the password admin. Admin can add and delete
users and also configure other advanced options. To configure advanced
options enter the configuration page by pressing on Configuration menu
item. </p>

<p class="subtitle"><strong><a name="localparams"></a>Configuring
local psiblast server</strong></p>

<p class="text">You acquire the ability to perform
periodical searches on your own server if you configure a local
PSI-BLAST server. If you do not need this ability you can skip this
paragraph. </p>

<p class="text">For the system to execute PSI-BLAST
searches on your server, the ssh server software must be installed
there. Also, the following options must be configured on Re-searcher:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Blast Server Hostname or IP address: Your server's address.</li>

  <li>Blast Server SSH Username: Username that will be used to
connect to the server and perform PSI-BLAST searches.</li>

  <li>Blast Server SSH Password: You need to specify password
that will be used to connect to the blast server. IMPORTANT NOTE:
sometimes password authentication is disabled on ssh servers for
security reasons. In that case, leave this field empty and use public
key authentication. </li>

  <li>Path to the Private Key File on the Web Server: Fill this
field and leave 'Blast Server SSH Password' field empty if you use
public key authentication. This field must contain the path to the
private key, for instance, 'c:\documents\private.ppk' </li>

  <li>Passphrase for the Private Key: if there is no passphrase
or you do not use public key authentication leave this field blank.</li>

  <li>Command Used to Invoke PSI-BLAST: path to the PSI-BLAST
executable, for instance '/usr/local/blast/bin/blastpgp'</li>

  <li>Command Used to Invoke Fastacmd: path to the fastacmd
executable, for instance '/usr/local/blast/bin/fastacmd'</li>

  <li>Path for Temporary File Storage: folder for temporary files
on blast server, for instance: /tmp/ </li>

  <li>Number of Processors to Use for Blast: enter the number of
processors you have or want to use on a blast server. </li>

</ul>

<p class="text">You also need to define the databases for
the local blast server. To add a new database, enter the name of the
database and a path to it in the corresponding fields at the bottom of
the configuration page and press add. For instance, the name can be:
'NR', path: '/usr/local/blast/data/nr'. You can see all the databases
in the table on the bottom right.</p>

<p class="subtitle"><strong><a name="emailparams"></a>Configuring
email notification options </strong></p>
<ul>

  <li>SMTP Hostname: this address is used to send emails after
new hits were found. </li>

  <li>Email From: When user gets notification he sees this email
address as a sender of the message.</li>

  <li>Application Link (Needed to Generate a Link to a Hit List):
If you fill this field, users will get the link to the hits list on
their emails. It is a very convenient option since user can view new
hits at once, without logging in. Usually what you fill-in will be
'http://localhost:8080/Researcher/app'. You can also leave this field
blank, then emails will not contain the link to the hits list.</li>

</ul>

<p class="subtitle"><strong>Configuring other
options</strong></p>
<ul>

  <li>Allow User Registration: if this field is set on, 'Create
new user' link appears on the login page so new users can register
themselves. </li>

</ul>


<span class="title">6. Using Re-searcher</span><a name="6" id="6"></a>
<p class="text">You need to have a user account to work
with Researcher. Administrator can create one for you. Also, you can
create it yourself if you see the 'Crete new user' link on the login
page. To create an account, follow the link, enter your data and press
create new user button. Now use your username and password to log in.</p>

<p class="subtitle"><strong>New Sequence page </strong></p>

<p class="text">After you log in, you are redirected to
the sequence list (which is empty if you logged in for the first time).
To enter a new sequence for the PSI-BLAST search follow the "New
Sequence" link on menu and click "Add" button after specifying search
parameters. Exhaustive description for search parameters is provided in
a&nbsp;<a href="nsparams.html">separate document</a>.</p>

<p class="text">To perform a double search you need to
specify the secondary database. Double search means that after
performing the search against the primary database PSI-BLAST will use
generated PSSM to run one additional iteration against the secondary
database. This strategy is often very useful in detecting distant
homologs in a small database (such as PDB sequences).</p>

<pclass ="text">The search should start in a few minutes
after entering a new sequence. Searches are executed sequentially and
there may be a longer delay if other searches are running at the time. </pclass>
<p class="text">A single search can take anywhere from
minutes to hours depending on search parameters and a number of hits. </p>

<p class="subtitle"><strong>Sequence List page </strong></p>

<p class="text">The sequence list page shows the main
information about every sequence entered. The row in the table of
sequences is colored red if new hits were found for the corresponding
sequence. There are four links in every row of the table. </p>

<p class="text">By pressing the query details link you
enter the page with all the information about the search and the
sequence. If you press the 'Search Now' the search for the sequence
will be started as soon as possible, usually in a few minutes. Number
of hits and new hits (in brackets) are shown on Hits column. By
pressing on it you enter the hits page. You delete the sequence and all
it's hits by pressing the delete link. </p>

<p class="subtitle"><strong>Hits page </strong></p>

<p class="text">All hits for the specific query are listed
here. There is a possibility to order the hits table by any column. New
hits are marked red. To mark all hits as old, press 'mark all hits as
old' link. To see the alignment, press the 'Alignment' link. To see the
sequence of the hit, press the id of the hit. To get fasta-formated
sequences of the hits follow the 'View New Sequences' or the 'View All
Sequences' link. </p>
