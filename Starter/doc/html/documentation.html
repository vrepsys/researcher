      <span class="title"> 1. About Re-searcher <a name="1" id="1"></a></span>
      <p class="text">
        Re-searcher is the
        system for recurrent psiblast searches. It enables timely detection
        of new proteins on the protein sequence databases. Searches can be
        done on a local server or at NCBI. It has a user-friendly web
        interface.
      </p>

        <p class="text">Re-searcher was created by Valdemaras Repšys,
        Mindaugas Margelevičius and Česlovas Venclovas in the <a
        href="http://www.ibt.lt/bioinformatics/">Institute of Biotechnology,
        Laboratory of Bioinformatics</a>, Vilnius, Lithuania</p>

        <p class="text">Using Re-searcher you can enter new protein
        sequences and choose psiblast parameters for the search. Each user
        has his own sequence list (or psiblast queries list) on which psiblst
        searches are executed periodically.</p>

        <p class="text">Sequences which have new hits are marked with red
        color. User can always see all the hits found. New hits are also
        marked with red color. User gets an email when new hits are found if
        he chooses to get it when entering a new sequence. Also SMTP address
        must be configured for this feature to work. </p>

        <p class="text">There is a possibility to perform double searches.
        Search is being performed on two distinct databases then. For
        instance, you can choose to perform the primary search on NR database
        and the secondary search on PDB database. Then the last iteration
        will be performed on PDB database using PSSM from the search on NR
        database. </p>
        <span class="title">2. Getting Re-searcher </span><a name="2" id="2"></a>
      <p class="text">
        Re-searcher is an open source project licensed under GPL license. You
        can download for free from <a
        href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=173135">here</a>.
		</p>
		
      <span class="title">3. Installing Re-searcher </span><a name="3"
        id="3"></a>
      <p class="text">Make sure that you have
        java runtime environment version 6 or higher and java binary is in
        your path. You can check java version and whether it is in path by
        writing 'java -version' in your command line. If you don't have java,
        you can download it from <a
        href="http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp">here </a>. </p>

        <p class="text">Download researcher-windows.tar.gz or
        researcher-linux.tar.gz for windows or linux operating systems
        respectively. Uncompress the archive to the desired location. That's
        it! </p>

        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Additional Notes </strong></p>

        <p class="text">If you use linux and the application is to be used
        publicly it is recommended that all permissions of Re-searcher's
        files are granted to a separate user and the application itself is
        started by this user. </p>

        <p class="text">Also, sometimes, you might want to change the
        hostname or the port of the Re-searcher's web server, this can be
        done by editing config/config.properties file. </p>

        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Running Re-searcher on your own web server
        </strong></p>

        <p class="text">Re-searcher comes bundled with Jetty web server.
        If you want to run Re-searcher on your own web server (like Tomcat),
        you have to download one of the installation archives and save the
        researcher.jar from there. researcher.jar contains the standard
        directory hierarchy for a java web application. IMPORTANT: When
        running Re-searearcher using your own java web server (servlet
        container) you must set a few java options: derby.system.home -
        directory for Re-searcher's database (usually just a location of an
        empty direcory, database get's created there automatically on the
        first run), log4j.conf - path to the log4j.properties file. You can
        get an example of log4j.properties from one of the Re-searcher's
        archives conf/log4j.properties </p>
        
        <span class="title">4. Starting and stopping Re-searcher </span><a name="4" id="4"></a>
		  <p class="subtitle"><strong>Windows</strong></p>

        <p class="text">To start the Re-searcher you can execute
        bin/researcher.bat. </p>

        <p class="text">If you want Re-searcher to start every time you
        boot your computer you can install it as a windows service by
        clicking on bin/install-service.bat. After installing a service you
        might want to start it with bin/start-service.bat. To stop the
        service execute the bin/stop-service.bat file. To uninstall the
        service execute bin/uninstall-service.bat file. </p>

        <p class="text">The application can take a few minutes to start.
        To start using Re-searcher go to the following link in your web
        browser: http://localhost:8080/Researcher/app (sometimes localhost
        must be replaced by a different hostname, if it is configured like
        this in config/config.properties file) </p>

        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Linux</strong></p>

        <p class="text">In linux Re-searcher is controlled with
        bin/researcher file. 'bin/researcher start' command starts the
        program in the background process, 'bin/researcher stop' stops it.
        'bin/researcher status' shows whether the program is currently
        running or not. </p>

        <p class="text">Also it is possible to start Re-searcher in the
        current console, to see all output. For this you need to execute
        'bin/researcher console' command. You can stop it by pressing ctrl+c
        then. </p>

        <p class="text">The application can take a few minutes to start.
        To start using Re-searcher go to the following link in your web
        browser: http://localhost:8080/Researcher/app (sometimes localhost
        must be replaced by a different hostname, if it is configured like
        this in config/config.properties file) </p>
        <span class="title">5. Configuring Re-searcher </span><a name="5" id="5"></a>
        <p class="text">When you run the
        application for the first time, you might want to configure some
        options like local psiblast server address, SMTP address and so
        on.</p>

        <p class="text">To access the application enter the address
        http://localhost:8080/Researcher/app to your web browser. The login
        window should appear. When application runs for the first time, user
        <em>admin</em> is created with the password <em>admin</em>. Admin can
        add and delete users also configure other advanced options. To
        configure advanced options enter the configuration page by pressing
        on Configuration menu item. </p>

        <p class="subtitle"><strong><a name="localparams"></a>Configuring local psiblast
        server</strong></p>

        <p class="text">You acquire the ability to perform periodical
        searches on your own server if you configure local psiblast server.
        If you do not need this ability you can skip this paragraph. </p>

        <p class="text">For the system to execute psiblast searches on
        your server, ssh server software must be installed there. Also the
        following options must be configured on Re-searcher:</p>
		  
        <ul>
          <li>Blast Server Hostname or IP address: Your server's address.</li>
          <li>Blast Server SSH Username: Username that will be used to
            connect to the server and perform psiblast searches.</li>
          <li>Blast Server SSH Password: You need to specify password that
            will be used to connect to the blast server. IMPORTANT NOTE:
            sometimes password authentication is disabled on ssh servers for
            security reasons. In that case, leave this field empty and use
            public key authentication. </li>
          <li>Path to the Private Key File on the Web Server: Fill this field
            and leave 'Blast Server SSH Password' field empty if you use
            public key authentication. This field must contain the path to
            the private key, for instance, 'c:\documents\private.ppk' </li>
          <li>Passphrase for the Private Key: if there is no passphrase or
            you do not use public key authentication leave this field
          blank.</li>
          <li>Command Used to Invoke Psiblast: path to the psiblast
            executable, for instance '/usr/local/blast/bin/blastpgp'</li>
          <li>Command Used to Invoke Fastacmd: path to the fastacmd
            executable, for instance '/usr/local/blast/bin/blastpgp'</li>
          <li>Path for Temporary File Storage: folder for temporary files on
            blast server, for instance: /tmp/ </li>
          <li>Number of Processors to Use for Blast: enter the number of
            processors you have or want to use on blast server. </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text">You also need to define the databases for the
        local psiblast server. To add new database enter the name of the
        database and a path to the fields at the bottom of the configuration
        page and press add. For instance name can be: 'NR', path:
        '/usr/local/blast/data/nr'. You can see all the databases in the
        table on the bottom right.</p>

        <p class="subtitle"><strong><a name="emailparams"></a>Configuring email notification options
        </strong></p>

        <p class="text">
        <ul>
          <li>SMTP Hostname: this address is used to send emails after new
            hits were found. </li>
          <li>Email From: When user gets notification he sees this email as a
            sender of the message.</li>
          <li>Application Link (Needed to Generate a Link to a Hit List): If
            you fill this field, users will get the link to the hits list on
            their emails. It is a very convenient, because user can view new
            hits at once, without logging in. Usually what you fill will be
            'http://localhost:8080/Researcher/app'. You can also leave this
            field blank, then emails will not contain the link to the hits
            list.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Configuring other options </strong></p>

        <p class="text">
        <ul>
          <li>Allow User Registration: if this field is set on, 'Create new
            user' link appears on the login page so users can register
            themselves. </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <span class="title">6. Using Re-searcher</span><a name="6" id="6"></a>
			<p class="text">You need to have a user
        account to work with Researcher. Administrator can create one. Also,
        you can create it yourself if you see the 'Crete new user' link on
        the login page. To create an account follow the link, enter your data
        and press create new user button. Now use your username and password
        to log in.</p>

        <p class="subtitle"><strong>New Sequence page </strong></p>

        <p class="text">After you log in you are redirected to the
        sequence list (which is empty if you logged in for the first time).
        To enter a new sequence for psiblast search follow the "New Sequence"
        link on menu and click "Add" button after specifying search
        parameters. Exhaustive description for search parameters is provided
        in a <a href="nsparams.html">separate document</a>.</p>

        <p class="text">To perform a double search you need to specify the
        secondary database. Double search means that after performing the
        search on the primary database there will be one more iteration
        performed on the secondary database using primary searche's PSSM.</p>

        <pclass="text">The search should start in few minutes after
        entering a new sequence. Though searches are executed sequentially
        and there may be a longer delay if other searches are running at the
        time. </p>

        <p class="text">One search can take from 5 minutes to 1 hour or
        more sometimes. It depends on search parameters and a number of hits.
        </p>

        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Sequence List page </strong></p>

        <p class="text">Sequence list page shows the main information
        about every sequence entered. The row of the sequence's table is
        marked red if new hits were found for that sequence. There are four
        links in every row of the table. </p>

        <p class="text">By pressing query details link you enter the page
        with all information about the search and the sequence. If you press
        the 'Search Now' the search for the sequence will be started as soon
        as possible, usually in a few minutes. Number of hits and new hits
        (in brackets) are shown on Hits column. By pressing on it you enter
        the hits page. You delete the sequence and all it's hits by pressing
        delete link. </p>

        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Hits page </strong></p>

        <p class="text">All hits for the specific query are listed here.
        There is a possibility to order the hits table by any column. New
        hits are marked red. To mark all hits as old press 'Mark All Hits As
        Old' link. To check the alignment press 'Alignment' link. To see the
        fasta of the hits press the id of the hit. To get fastas of the hits
